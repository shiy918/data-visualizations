# Data Visualization on Alcohol Consumption

This web application includes two data visualizations using data extracted from one dataset that contains alcohol consumption of all countries around the world. 

## The Process
The first part of the project is to filter through the original dataset using Excel and extract essential information for the visualizations. It includes the top ten countries of pure alcohol consumption and top tens in each of the three alcohol categories. An extra column of continent for each country is appended to bring the insights on a global scale.

The second part is the visualization using Chart.js and D3.js. D3.js in this case is primarily used for importing the data whereas Chart.js is utilized for the charts.
